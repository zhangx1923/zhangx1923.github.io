## About Me
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern Maine.  I got my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of South Carolina, under the direction of Dr. Xiaofeng Wang, where I focused on the topic of how to quantitatively evaluate and enhance the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). My current research interest includes computer vision, applied deep learning, and machine learning.
