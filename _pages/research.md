## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the areas of computer vision, applied deep learning, and machine learning.

## Research Projects

### Refining and Generalizing Trained CNNs
- Presenting refinement methods to mitigate overfitting and reduce the number of parameters.

### Utilizing Mutation Test to Evaluate the Robustness of CNNs

- Presenting D-Score to assess CNNs' robustness and fitness to specific datasets through mutation operators.
- Proposing a D-Score guided data augment method to improve CNNs' robustness with respect to feature shifting.


### Vision-based Depth Estimation from Monocular Single Image
- Presented an attention mechanism-based deep learning network and a novel loss function.
- Effectively generated depth maps for each pixel from only one image. 
- Extensive experiments showed that it beats most SOTA methods, published a paper at a conference.

### Multi-label Classification on Images with Missing Labels 
- Proposed several approaches to address the problem of classification with partially-labeled data.
- Alleviating label imbalance, especially in large labeling spaces.
- Implemented by Python and PyTorch and experimented on several large-scale image datasets. 

### Quantum Programming and Computing
- Investigated IBM QISKit extensively, and existing quantum programming methods and algorithms.
- Proposed an effective compilation method of quantum programs, which only uses 74.7\% of the logic gates of the IBM standard method and the efficiency is increased by 7.75 times.
- Published one research paper at a conference and translated one book from English to Chinese.
