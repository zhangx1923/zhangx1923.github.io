## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the areas of computer vision, applied deep learning, and machine learning.

## Research Projects

### Utilizing Mutation Test to Evaluate the Robustness of CNNs

#### Presenting D-Score to assess CNNs' robustness and fitness to specific datasets through mutation operators.
#### Proposing a D-Score guided data augment method to improve CNNs' robustness with respect to feature shifting.
#### Presenting refinement method to mitigate overfitting and reduce the number of parameters.

### Vision-based Depth Estimation from Monocular Single Image
#### Presented an attention mechanism-based deep learning network and a novel loss function.
#### Effectively generated depth maps for each pixel from only one image. 
#### Extensive experiments showed that it beats most SOTA methods, published a paper at a conference.

### Multi-label Classification on Image with Missing Labels 
#### Proposed several approaches to address the problem of classification with partially-labeled data.
#### Alleviating label imbalance, especially in large labeling space.
#### Implemented by Python and PyTorch and experimented on several large-scale image datasets. 

### Quantum Programming and Computing
#### Investigated IBM QISKit extensively, and existing quantum programming methods and algorithms.
#### Proposed an effective compilation method of quantum programs, which only uses 74.7\% of the logic gates of IBM standard method, and the efficiency is increased by 7.75 times.
#### Published one research paper at a conference and translate one book from English to Chinese.
